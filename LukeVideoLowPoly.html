          Of course sunglasses! Because coders know you can't get enough sleep so you always look better with them than without.
          I'm not sure yet wich ones look best? If you want to help me click <button id="sunglassesChange" type="button">Click Me!</button> !

          Yeah ! I need my dose of music on a daily basis. I complete my playlists with creative commons tracks i like from CChits, Jamendo or RatholeRadio. But thats not all i also love my podcatcher ! I listen to quite a few linux and tech related podcasts. So you bet if there has been a new kernel release or a new version of any major linux distribution the chances are i'm allready trying it out!

          Badges ! I love them. I have 100+ on codecademy. I also have a few on Openclassrooms. My favourites are the ones i earned on Blender, blend4web forums. But i also have a collection in real life. I even bought my own button maker to make my very personal badges. Gnu/Linux quotes or my favorite text editor... I have them all !

            I always have it with me. It's my toolbox. I have my personal workflow suite. It's full of good things i collected from my previous experiences and my degrees. I carry just as much knoledge and skills as actual tools. Check it out on my resume. Found out even more on my LinkedIn !
            Feel free to ask me for more ! I have a strong belief in the strenth of openness in education as well as in devellopement. Let's talk about that !
